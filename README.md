# AI-Generated-Video-Detection
AI-Generated Video Detection using transformer-based models (UNITE &amp; UNITE-CL). The pipeline extracts video frames, generates embeddings (SigLIP/ViT), and classifies content as real or AI-generated. Supports continual learning and cross-dataset evaluation for robust, scalable detection.
